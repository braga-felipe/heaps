## Welcome to _heaps_ !

An app for sharing food with people near you and reducing waste. 
Users can upload items, categorized as either dishes or groceries, which can be discovered based on oneâ€™s geographical location. 
Users can also request items, and communicate through the chat to coordinate the pick-up at a preferred time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository with the command and get into the main directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/braga-felipe/heaps
   cd heaps
   ```
2. Get into the server directory and install the dependencies

   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. From the server directory, get into the client directory and install the dependencies there as well

   ```bash
   cd ../client

   ```

4. The app uses a PostgreSQL database. In the server/index.ts file, on line 52, replace the _process.env.DB_URL_ with a link to your own PostgreSQL database.

   ```bash
    ...
    await createConnection({
    url: process.env.DB_URL, # <---- enter your URL here!
    type: 'postgres',
    ...
    ...
   ```
